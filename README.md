# CS2101. 
1. This project implements a program that simulates a bank account, allowing users to calculate and display financial information based on user input, such as initial balance, monthly deposits, interest rate, and number of years.

2. The code effectively encapsulates the functionality within the BankAccount class, providing clear separation of concerns and promoting code reusability.

3. One area for enhancement could be adding input validation and error handling to ensure that the user provides valid input. This would make the code more robust and prevent unexpected behaviors.

4. Writing the table display logic in the `displayTable` function might have been challenging due to the formatting requirements. To overcome this, careful consideration of the column widths and using the `setw` function from the `<iomanip>` library were used. Additionally, resources such as documentation and online examples can be valuable for handling formatting challenges.

5. Skills transferable from this project include object-oriented design, encapsulation, and separation of concerns. Additionally, working with input/output, data manipulation, and formatting techniques will be useful in other projects or coursework.

6. The code is structured in a modular and organized manner, utilizing a class to encapsulate related functionality. Meaningful variable names, comments, and consistent formatting were employed to improve maintainability, readability, and adaptability of the code.
